- Real-time updates for a conversation when a new message is added.

- Real-time notifications for the user (e.g., new message in a conversation they are not currently viewing, or other app notifications).

We'll create:

Model: Notification

WebSocket Consumer: NotificationConsumer (for notifications) and ChatConsumer (for chat) - OR we can combine.
