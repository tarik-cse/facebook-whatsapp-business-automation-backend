### Explanation:

- **Throttling**: It is a mechanism to control the rate of requests that a client can make to an API. This is important to prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and protect against denial-of-service attacks.

- **Scope**: The `throttle_scope` allows you to group multiple views under the same throttle rate limit. You define a named scope (like 'profile') and then set the rate for that scope in the DRF settings.

### How it works:

1. In your view, you set `throttle_scope = 'profile'`.

2. In your DRF settings, you define a throttle rate for the scope 'profile', e.g., `'profile': '5/minute'`.

3. When a request comes to that view, DRF checks the number of requests made by the client (identified by user or IP) in the current time window for the scope 'profile'. If the number exceeds the limit, it returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

### Example:

In `settings.py`:

```python

REST_FRAMEWORK = {

'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [

'rest_framework.throttling.ScopedRateThrottle',

],

'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {

'profile': '5/minute',   # 5 requests per minute

}

}

```

In the view:

```python

class UserProfileView(APIView):

throttle_scope = 'profile'   # This view uses the 'profile' throttle rate

...

```

### Notes:

- The `ScopedRateThrottle` class must be included in `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES` (or set per view) for the `throttle_scope` to work.

- You can also set the throttle classes per view if you don't want to set it globally.

### Alternative Throttling Classes in DRF:

1. `AnonRateThrottle`: Limits for anonymous users (by IP).

2. `UserRateThrottle`: Limits for authenticated users (by user ID).

3. `ScopedRateThrottle`: For custom scopes (as above).

### Why use throttle_scope in the profile view?

- To prevent brute-force attacks or excessive requests that might overload the server.

- For the profile view, you might want to allow a reasonable number of updates/accesses per minute to avoid abuse.

### How to adjust:

You can adjust the rate string in `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES` to:

- `'100/day'`

- `'10/hour'`

- `'5/minute'`

- `'1/second'`
