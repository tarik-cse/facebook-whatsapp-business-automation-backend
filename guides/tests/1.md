```

# 2. run all tests
```
python manage.py test
```

# 3. Run tests for a specific app
```sh
python manage.py test account
```
# 4. Run a specific test module
```sh
python manage.py test account.tests.test_delete_account
```
# 5. Run a specific test class or method
```sh
# Specific class
python manage.py test account.tests.test_delete_account.UserDeleteAccountTests

# Specific method
python manage.py test account.tests.test_delete_account.UserDeleteAccountTests.test_authenticated_user_can_delete_self
````

# If python manage.py test says Ran 0 tests, check:

- Test file is named test_*.py
- Test class inherits from unittest.TestCase or APITestCase
- Class/method names start with test_
- App is listed in INSTALLED_APPS
